Here, our aim is to investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponential distribution in R and simulate this exponential distribution 1000 times and compare it with Central Limit Theorem(CLT) or Normal Distribution.

### Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions

Code Explanation of Part 1

```{r cars}
set.seed(10000)
n <- 40
lambda <- 0.2
sim_function <- function(a,b)
simulations <- 1000
exp_data <- rexp(n, lambda)
mean_data <- 1/lambda
standard_deviation_data <- 1/lambda

```

### Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Code Explanation of Part 2
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
